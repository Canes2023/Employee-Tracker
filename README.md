# Employee-Tracker

For this assignment, I was tasked with creating a employee tracker that tracks all departments, all roles, all employees, allows the user to add a employee, add a role, add a department, and update a employee role. My application does some of it. The UI is complete but I have been having trouble getting the information to show. I will fix these bugs in time. I don't like turning in a application that isn't finished but I was told to just submit it and focus on the next assignment so I don't fall behind. I will have it completed soon. I believe the issues has to do with my schema.sql file. 

Code source is from me. The location of the code is in the root directory of the repo.
